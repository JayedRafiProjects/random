Built this program in my first year of undergrad. Does not have much front-end or GUI implementation as
I was mostly focusing on back-end demonstration. It uses a simple LinkedList data structure to store and
process the information and follows the basic rules of object-oriented programming. Well, this is not
the best program to implement a reservation system as it lacks some quality but from my perspective, 
it is a very good implementation to understand oop and LinkedList data structure. Feel free to use 
and improve this as you want.
